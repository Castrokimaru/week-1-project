# Student Grade Generator, Speed Detector, and Net Salary Calculator

  ## Description
This repository contains solutions to three JavaScript challenges:
1. Student Grade Generator
2. Speed Detector
3. Net Salary Calculator

### Challenge 1: Student Grade Generator
This program prompts the user to input student marks between 0 and 100, then outputs the corresponding grade based on the following criteria:
- A > 79
- B - 60 to 79
- C - 49 to 59
- D - 40 to 49
- E - less than 40

### Challenge 2: Speed Detector
This program takes the speed of a car as input and:
- If the speed is less than 70, it prints "Ok"
- For every 5 km/s above the speed limit (70), it gives one demerit point
- If the driver gets more than 12 points, it prints "License suspended"

### Challenge 3: Net Salary Calculator
This program calculates an individual's Net Salary by getting inputs of basic salary and benefits. It calculates:
- Gross salary (basic salary + benefits)
- PAYE (Tax) based on KRA tax bands
- NHIF Deductions
- NSSF Deductions
- Net salary (gross salary - deductions)
